5. Project description.

BONVO PROPERTIES NFT

Bonvo Properties NFT, is a decentralized app with a variety of features. The purpose of the platform is to bring actualized real estate information in real time to the user.

Bonvo allows the user to create and collect housing for rent information, gathered following different parameters.

Bonvo Properties NFT is a series of smart contracts deployed on Moonbeam and Polygon networks. It allows the user to create an ERC-721, or “Mint” an NFT. The Property NFT when created, contains the house or apartment information given by the user. This NFT is the user property. It has the possibility to be a cross chain NFT. The tokens can exist in the Moonbeam network and the Polygon network. The novel feature introduced for this hackathon of Bonvo Dapp, is that the user can transfer his Properties NFT to the Polygon network, by using Axelar GMP. This is possible using the Axelar GMP, the token can be transferred between networks. The token metadata is stored on IPFS.

Besides that, the user can win rewards, paid in BNV tokens, a fungible token, built to reward users and to create value within the community.

Every time that the user mint or create a new property, receive BNV tokens as a reward. Also every time that the user leaves a review in the platform, it also receives BNV tokens as a reward.

9.Problem description.

  

The problem lies in the lack of adequate economic incentives for tenants and tenants when loading their properties on rental platforms.

  
  

10.Solution or how it helps to solve the problem.

  

It seeks to encourage the rental or rent of properties of houses or apartments. Properties NFT allows you to earn rewards, every time the user uploads or mints a new rental property, this is achieved through the virtual wallet link, uploading the data of the property to be rented and uploading a photograph. By performing this action the user receives:

  

1- His “Property NFT”, A unique non-fungible token (ERC-721) that represents his property and can be transferred or rented and in the future sold in different marketplaces.

2- Also receive BNV tokens as a reward. More benefits are expected to be delivered in the future. It seeks to provide transparency to people who rent an apartment as well as to the owners of houses and/or condominiums, making this information accessible on the blockchain.
